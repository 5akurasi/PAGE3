    <div class="howtocoffee">
        <h3 class="text1">The journey of coffee beans begins in lush plantations spread across the equatorial belt, where coffee trees flourish in rich soil under the right balance of sunlight and rainfall. These trees produce small, cherry-like fruits, each containing two precious seeds—what we know as coffee beans.Harvesting coffee is a meticulous process. In many regions, skilled farmers handpick only the ripest cherries, ensuring the highest quality. Some farms, especially large-scale plantations, use mechanical harvesters to speed up the process. Once harvested, the cherries undergo one of two primary processing methods: the dry process or the wet process.</h3>
        <h5 class="text2">1. Dry Process (Natural Method): The cherries are spread out under the sun to dry, turned regularly to prevent spoilage. This traditional method enhances the beans' natural sweetness and fruitiness.</h5>
        <h5 class="text3">2. Wet Process (Washed Method): The cherries are pulped to remove the outer skin, then fermented in water to break down the remaining mucilage before being washed and dried. This results in a cleaner, more refined flavor profile.</h5>
        <h4 class="text4">After drying, the beans are hulled to remove any remaining layers and sorted meticulously based on size, weight, and quality. Only the best beans make it to the next stage—roasting—where they develop the rich aroma and deep flavors that coffee lovers cherish.From the hands of farmers to your cup, every step in coffee bean harvesting plays a crucial role in delivering the perfect brew.</h4>
